    "# Fine-tune Embedding models for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding models are crucial for successful RAG applications, but they're often trained on general knowledge, which limits their effectiveness for company or domain specific adoption. Customizing embedding models on your domain specific data can significantly improve retrieval performance of your RAG Application. With the new release of [Sentence Transformers 3](https://huggingface.co/blog/train-sentence-transformers), it's easier than ever to fine-tune embedding models. \n",
