    "# How to Fine-Tune Multimodal Models or VLMs with Hugging Face TRL\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal LLMs are making tremendous progress recently. We now have a diverse ecosystem of powerful open Multimodal models, mostly Vision-Language Models (VLM), including Meta AI's [Llama-3.2-11B-Vision](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct), Mistral AI's [Pixtral-12B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Pixtral-12B-2409), Qwen's [Qwen2-VL-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B), and Allen AI's [Molmo-7B-D-0924](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Molmo-7B-D-0924).\n",
    "\n",
    "These VLMs can handle a variety of multimodal tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and image-text matching without additional training. However, to customize a model for your specific application, you may need to fine-tune it on your data to achieve higher quality results or to create a more efficient model for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post walks you through how to fine-tune open VLMs using Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) in 2024. We'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define our multimodal use case \n",
    "1. Setup development environment\n",
    "2. Create and prepare the multimodal dataset\n",
    "3. Fine-tune VLM using `trl` and the `SFTTrainer` \n",
    "4. Test and evaluate the VLM\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This blog was created to run on consumer size GPUs (24GB), e.g. NVIDIA A10G or RTX 4090/3090, but can be easily adapted to run on bigger GPUs._\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Define our multimodal use case \n",
    "\n",
    "When fine-tuning VLMs, it's crucial to clearly define your use case and the multimodal task you want to solve. This will guide your choice of base model and help you create an appropriate dataset for fine-tuning. If you haven't defined your use case yet, you might want to revisit your requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that for most use cases fine-tuning might note be the first option. We recommend evaluating pre-trained models or API-based solutions before committing to fine-tuning your own model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we'll use the following multimodal use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We want to fine-tune a model that can generate detailed product descriptions based on product images and basic metadata. This model will be integrated into our e-commerce platform to help sellers create more compelling listings. The goal is to reduce the time it takes to create product descriptions and improve their quality and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing models might already be very good for this use case, but you might want to tweak/tune it to your specific needs. This image-to-text generation task is well-suited for fine-tuning VLMs, as it requires understanding visual features and combining them with textual information to produce coherent and relevant descriptions."

    "Once you have determined that fine-tuning is the right solution we need to create a dataset to fine-tune our model. The dataset should be a diverse set of demonstrations of the task you want to solve. There are several ways to create such a dataset, including:\n",
    "* Using existing open-source datasets, e.g., [Spider](https://huggingface.co/datasets/spider)\n",
    "* Using LLMs to create synthetically datasets, e.g., [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca)\n",
    "* Using Humans to create datasets, e.g., [Dolly](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k).\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of the methods has its own advantages and disadvantages and depends on the budget, time, and quality requirements. For example, using an existing dataset is the easiest but might not be tailored to your specific use case, while using humans might be the most accurate but can be time-consuming and expensive. It is also possible to combine several methods to create an instruction dataset, as shown in [Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we will use an already existing dataset called [sql-create-context](https://huggingface.co/datasets/b-mc2/sql-create-context), which contains samples of natural language instructions, schema definitions and the corresponding SQL query.\n",
