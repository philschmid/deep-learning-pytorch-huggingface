    "In this blog, you will learn how to fine-tune [google/flan-t5-xl](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xl) for chat & dialogue summarization using Hugging Face Transformers. If you already know T5, FLAN-T5 is just better at everything. For the same number of parameters, these models have been fine-tuned on more than 1000 additional tasks covering also more languages. \n",

    "FLAN-T5 released with the [Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) paper is an enhanced version of T5 that has been finetuned in a mixture of tasks. The paper explores instruction finetuning with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) finetuning on chain-of-thought data. The paper discovers that overall instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models. \n",
