    "# Quantize open LLMs using optimum and GPTQ\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hugging Face Optimum team collaborated with AutoGPTQ library to provide a simple API that apply GPTQ quantization on language models. With GPTQ quantization open LLMs to 8, 4, 3 or even 2 bits to run them on smaller Hardware without a big drop of performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the blog, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup our development environment\n",
    "2. Prepare quantization dataset\n",
    "3. Load and Quantize Model\n",
    "4. Test performance and inference speed\n",
    "5. Bonus: Run Inference with Text Generation Inference\n",
    "  \n",
    "But we before we get started lets take quick look on what GPTQ does. \n",

    "## What is GPTQ?\n",
    "\n",
    "[GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) is a post-training quantziation method to compress LLMs, like GPT. GPTQ compresses GPT models by reducing the number of bits needed to store each weight in the model, from 32 bits down to just 3-4 bits. This means the model takes up much less memory, so it can run on less Hardware, e.g. Single GPU for 13B Llama2 models. GPTQ analyzes each layer of the model separately and approximating the weights in a way that preserves the overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefits are:\n",
    "* Quantizes the weights of the model layer-by-layer to 4 bits instead of 16 bits, this reduces the needed memory by 4x.\n",
    "* Quantization is done gradually to minimize the accuracy loss from quantization.\n",
    "* Achieves same latency as fp16 model, but 4x less memory usage, sometimes faster due to custom kernels, e.g. [Exllama](https://github.com/turboderp/exllama)\n",
    "* Quantized weights can be saved to disk for a head of time quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: GPTQ quantization only works for text model for now. Futhermore, the quantization process can take a lot of time. You check on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=gptq) if there is not already a GPTQ quantized version of the model you want to use._\n",

In this blog, we are going to use the [WikiText](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext) dataset from the Hugging Face Hub.
