    "# How to align open LLMs in 2025 with DPO & Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) continued their important role in 2024, with several major developments completely outperforming previous models. The focus continued to more smaller, more powerful models from companies like Meta, Qwen, or Google. These models not only became more powerful, but also more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the reason is the continued scaling of post-training methods and datasets. Post-training methods like [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290), [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2203.02155), and [Group Preference Optimization (GRPO)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2310.11523) have been used to align models with human preferences, boosting performance and being more aligned with human preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing from [How to fine-tune open LLMs in 2025 with Hugging Face](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-llms-in-2025), this guide focuses on aligning models using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We'll build upon our previously fine-tuned model from the [Fine-Tune LLMs in 2025](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-llms-in-2025) guide and improve it further through preference learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let's take a look at the [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290) paper and understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is DPO?**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290) is a simplified approach to align language models with human preferences. Unlike traditional RLHF methods that require training a separate reward model and using complex PPO optimization, DPO treats the alignment problem as a classification task on preference data. This makes it more stable, efficient, and computationally lightweight compared to alternatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: DPO eliminates the need for a separate reward model and complex RL optimization, making it easier to implement and debug\n",
    "- **Stability**: By avoiding the instabilities of PPO training, DPO provides more reliable convergence\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: The direct optimization approach requires less compute and fewer hyperparameters than traditional RLHF\n",
    "- **Performance**: Despite its simplicity, DPO achieves comparable results\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll use offline DPO with on-Policy data. Offline DPO is the more compute-efficient, meaning we don't need a Reward model during training in memory. However, we will be staying on-policy. We'll first generate samples from the Supervised Fine-Tuned (SFT) model we trained in the previous guide and score them with a rule-based reward model that checks answer correctness. These scores will then be used to create preference pairs (a \"preferred\" and a \"rejected\" response) for DPO training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going to adjust the example to your own use case, which cannot be verified with a rule-based reward model, you can use a generic reward model like [nicolinho/QRM-Llama3.1-8B-v2](https://huggingface.co/nicolinho/QRM-Llama3.1-8B-v2), which ranks in the top 10 on reward bench or LLM as judge based on your own criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "1. [Setup the development environment](#1-setup-the-development-environment)\n",
    "2. [Create on-policy preference dataset from model outputs](#2-create-on-policy-preference-dataset)\n",
    "3. [Align the model using DPO and the Hugging Face `DPOTrainer`](#3-align-the-model-using-dpo)\n",
    "4. [Test and evaluate the aligned model](#4-test-and-evaluate)\n",

The `DPOTrainer` is a subclass of the `Trainer` from the `transformers` library and supports all the same features, including logging, checkpointing, distributed training, and parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290) aligns LLMs with human preferences using 'prompt', 'chosen', and 'rejected' columns, where each 'prompt' is paired with a 'chosen' response that aligns with human preferences and a 'rejected' response that does not.\n",

    "We prepared a [run_dpo.py](./scripts/dpo/run_dpo.py) scripts, which supports providing a yaml configuration file. This allows you to easily change the model, dataset, hyperparameters, and other settings. This is done by using the `TrlParser`, which parses the yaml file and converts it into the `TrainingArguments` arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) we know that we need to use a ~10-100x smaller learning rate for DPO compared to SFT. In our example we reduce the learning rate from 2e-4 (SFT) to 5e-6 (DPO) or 40x smaller. Another important parameter is the `beta` parameter, which is used to control the strength of the alignment, typically something in the range of 0.1 to 0.5. A higher beta means less divergence from the initial reference model or the text generations are very similar in terms of their probability distributions. "
