    "# Mini-R1: Reproduce Deepseek R1 „aha moment“ a RL tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "The release of Deepseek R1 shocked the industry. Why? Well, DeepSeek-R1 is an open model that rivals OpenAI's o1 in complex reasoning tasks, introduced using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and RL-focused multi-stage training approach. They not only released the model, but also a research paper on how they did it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper they described an \"aha moment\" when using pure RL to train the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero (the first test of DeepSeek-R1) learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach without any human feedback or data describing how to do it.  They describe this as an \"aha moment\" as:\n",
    " \n",
    "> This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future. In this blog post we want to recreate the small \"aha moment\" of DeepSeek-R1 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and the Countdown Game. We will train an open model using reinforcement learning trying to teach it self-verification and search abilities all on its own to solve the Countdown Game. The Countdown game is a numbers puzzle where players use a set of randomly drawn numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷) to reach or get as close as possible to a target number.\n",

    "```\n",

    "The blog post includes an interactive code which you can run in a Jupyter Notebook on how to train a model using GRPO and Q-Lora. This is a great way to learn how to use TRL and GRPO, but it is very slow and requires a lot of compute. Additionally, I added a [script](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-learning-pytorch-huggingface/blob/main/training/scripts/run_r1_grpo.py) and instructions to run the training on Node with multiple GPUs or a SLURM cluster. \n",

    "## Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. It was introduced in the [DeepSeekMath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300) paper in the context of mathematical reasoning. GRPO modifies the traditional Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the need for a value function model. Instead, it estimates baselines from group scores, reducing memory usage and computational overhead. GRPO, now also used by the Qwen team, can be used with rule/binary-based Rewards as well as General Reward Models to improve models on helpfulness. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling**: Generate multiple outputs for each prompt using the current policy\n",
    "2. **Reward Scoring**: Each generation is scored using a reward function, could be (rule-based or outcome-based)\n",
    "3. **Advantage Calculation**: The average reward of the generated outputs is used as a baseline. The advantage of each solution within the group is then computed relative to this baseline. The reward is normalized within a group.\n",
    "4. **Policy Optimization**: The policy tries to maximize the GRPO objective, which includes the calculated advantages and a KL divergence term. This is different from how PPO implements the KL term within the reward.\n",

    "More than 20 minutes per step with only 2 generations per sample is not feasible. We need to scale up our training. Hugging Face TRL added support for distributed training with Deepspeed and using vLLM for faster generation. I preprared a [run_r1_grpo.py](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-learning-pytorch-huggingface/blob/main/training/scripts/run_r1_grpo.py) script and a [receipes/grpo-qwen-2.5-3b-deepseek-r1-countdown.yaml](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-learning-pytorch-huggingface/blob/main/training/receipes/grpo-qwen-2.5-3b-deepseek-r1-countdown.yaml) config file to run the training. \n",

Therefore we need to make sure we correctly set the `num_processes` to the number of GPUs you have - 1 as the last one will be used with vLLM for Generation. If you are using more GPUS you need to change the `vllm_device` in the config file to last index GPU, e.g. if you have 8 GPUs you need to set `vllm_device=7` and your `num_processes` to 7.\n",

I ran some small ablations and decreased both the learning rate to 5e-7 and the beta to 0.001, based on a test from [OpenRLHF](https://hijkzzz.notion.site/unraveling-rlhf-and-its-variants-engineering-insights#147d9a33ecc9806090f3d5c749d31f05). I coulnd't test how increasing the `num_generations` from 8 to 64 would affect the training. 64 is the generation value, which was used in the DeepSeekMath paper.

This combination seems promising: 80 - (70 / 14) = 80 - 5 = 75, this still isn't quite right. Let me correct my approach: Let's use division and then addition. If I take 80 / (70 / 14) → 80 / 5 = 16, and then 80 - 16 = 64, still incorrect. Let me simplify: 80 / (70 / 14) → 80 / 5 = 16, and then 80 - 16 gives 64 again, let me correct: 80 - (70 / 14) → 80 - 5 = 75, but I need 85.

Another way is to see what happens if I subtract 21 from 90, which gives me 69. This is closer but still not 68. Let me use multiplication instead of subtraction. 90 * 1 = 90.

    "The release of DeepSeek R1 and its research paper might be breakpoint for the open-science and open-source development. Just a week after DeepSeek release, we've been able to reproduce a simple version of R1 learned \"reasoning\" using GRPO and the Countdown Game. While our implementation focuses on a specific task rather than general reasoning and convergence into a very specific \"reasoning\" format, it shows that the method is working. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our mini R1 experiment we used GRPO, with two rule-based reward but already required significant compute: 4 H100 GPUs running for 6 hours to complete just 450 training steps on a 3B parameter model. This gives us an idea of the compute needs that you will need to scale Reinforcement Learning. Deepseek ran a 671B model for over 8000 steps and they probably did many ablations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking in to 2025, it's clear that we are on the cusp of even more significant progress. RL will become more accessible and user-friendly, more researchers and developers will explore its potential, but also require amount of more compute as before and compared to supervised fine-tuning. \n",
